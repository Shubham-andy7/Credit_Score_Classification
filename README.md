### Project Title: Credit Score Classification
# Overview
This project is focused on developing a Credit Score Classification system using Machine Learning techniques. The aim is to build a model that can classify individuals into specific credit score categories based on a variety of financial and credit-related features, using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. By automating the classification process, this system reduces the manual effort typically involved in assessing credit scores.

# Problem Statement
The company has gathered a comprehensive dataset containing detailed bank and credit-related information. The goal is to leverage this data to develop an intelligent system that can classify individuals into credit score brackets automatically. The key objective is to create a robust and accurate predictive model using machine learning techniques.

# Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Credit Score Classification Dataset.
Size: 100,000 rows and 28 parameters.
Features:
Age
Credit Score
Monthly Salary
Other credit-related metrics.
Target Variable: Credit_Score (the categorical column used for classification).

# Preprocessing Challenges:
Irrelevant columns like ID and Customer_ID were dropped.
Numerical columns containing non-numerical entries were cleaned.
Anomalies such as extreme values (e.g., age 5000) were removed or corrected.

# Data Preprocessing
Steps undertaken to clean and prepare the data:

Remove Non-Essential Columns: Dropped irrelevant columns like ID and Customer_ID.
Correct Data Anomalies:
Fixed unrealistic entries, e.g., age 5000.
Removed garbage values from numerical columns.
Converted 'Credit_History_Age' to a numerical format.
Handle Imbalanced Data: Oversampling techniques were used to address the dataset imbalance.

# Classification Algorithms
We implemented and evaluated the following machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
AdaBoost
Bagging Classifier
Support Vector Classification (SVC)

# Visualization
The data was visualized using various techniques to better understand relationships and trends:

Heatmap: Highlighted correlations between features and the target variable.
Imbalance Visualization: Demonstrated the skew in the distribution of credit scores.

# Performance Evaluation
To assess model performance, we compared the accuracy of the different classification algorithms. Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost performed exceptionally well, showcasing higher accuracy compared to others.

# Future Work
Improving Accuracy: Explore additional classification algorithms to enhance the model’s performance.
Expanding the Dataset: Gather more data points to improve the robustness of the model.
Exploring Clustering Algorithms: Dive into clustering techniques to complement the classification model.
Neural Networks: Investigate the use of deep learning models to improve accuracy.

# Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated how machine learning techniques can be applied to credit score classification. The model developed effectively addresses the problem by leveraging robust data preprocessing techniques and powerful machine learning algorithms. Future improvements focus on expanding the model’s capabilities and accuracy through more advanced algorithms and better data quality.
